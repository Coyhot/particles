JavaScript Particle Playground
==============================

Dicking about with particles for shits and giggles. This is very much a sandbox
repo that I suspect I'll be playing with for a few days.

Current demo incorporates:

 *  Colour 2D particles
 *  Captures mouse movement
 *  Customisable velocities, drag, gravity, bounce, and particle size.
