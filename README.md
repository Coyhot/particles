JavaScript Particle Playground
==============================

Dicking about with particles for shits and giggles. This is very much a sandbox
repo that I suspect I'll be playing with for a few days.

Current demo incorporates:

 *  Colour 2D particles with position, velocity, and weight.
 *  Particle clusters with customisable velocities, drag, gravity,
    and particle size.
 *  Canvas director.
 *  3D particles.

Demo is running at <http://nefariousdesigns.co.uk/projects/particles/>

To do
-----

 *  Reintroduce mouse tracking(?)
